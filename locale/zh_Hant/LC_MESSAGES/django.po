msgid "Frequently Asked Questions"
msgstr ""

msgid "How frequently do the lists update?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The lists will update about once every hour. A full rescan is done every week."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why can't I take a name on a new account?"
msgstr ""

msgid "If a name is already taken by an account you can only obtain it via a name change. These names are shown with a green background. If a name isn't taken by a current user you can take it on a brand new account. These names are shown with a blue background."
msgstr ""

msgid "What if the account is banned?"
msgstr ""

msgid "If the account is banned it may be shown as being free with a green background, however it will remain unavailable indefinitely unless Riot changes their policy on banned accounts."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I get a 2 letter name?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The minimum characters for League of Legends names are 3. You can put a space between the characters to fix this."
msgstr ""

msgid "What timezone is used?"
msgstr ""

msgid "All timezones are in UTC. Use this <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20170502T220000&p1=1440\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">timezone converter</a> to adjust them to your local time."
msgstr ""

msgid "When exactly will the name become available?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Normally names are cleaned up at midnight UTC. However, in some cases I've found it has taken 48 hours. Check every few hours on the day it is listed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can you remove a name from a list for me?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No. All the names are automatically scanned."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where should I report an incorrect translation?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Contact me here."
msgstr ""

msgid "Where should I report a bug?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why are no pre Xayah and Rakan champion names allowed?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Riot has said they will no longer reserve names of new champions."
msgstr ""

msgid "However they banned the accounts of the old names so they will never expire."
